Although Fibonacci heaps looks efficient, they are not generally used in practical application because:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is complicated to code them. They are not as efficient in practice when compared with the theoretically less efficient forms of heaps, since in their simplest version they required storage and manipulation of four pointer per node, when compared to the two or three pointers per node needed for other structures.
	\item They have the reputation for being slow in practice due to large memory consumption per node and high constant factors on all operations.
\end{itemize}
